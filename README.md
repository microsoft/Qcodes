# Qcodes

Qcodes is a data acquisition framework being developed by the Copenhagen / Delft / Sydney / Microsoft quantum computing consortium. The goal is to create a common framework for all of our experiments, so:
- new students don't need to spend a long time learning software in order to participate in experiments
- nobody has to write their own code except for pieces that are very specific to their own experiment - and even then we will try to merge a lot of this code back into the main project.
- we streamline the process of moving between teams or labs, and of setting up a new experiment.
- we can take advantage of modern software and best practices so the system is easy to maintain and extend as needs and technologies change
