    "## Base Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 3 available:\n",
    "- `VisaInstrument` - for most instruments that communicate over a text channel (ethernet, GPIB, serial, USB...) that do not have a custom DLL or other driver to manage low-level commands.\n",
    "- `IPInstrument` - a deprecated driver just for ethernet connections. Do not use this; use `VisaInstrument` instead.\n",
    "- `Instrument` - superclass of both `VisaInstrument` and `IPInstrument`, use this if you do not communicate over a text channel, for example:\n",

    "## Parameters and Channels\n",
    "\n",
    "Broadly speaking, a QCoDeS instrument driver is nothing but an object that holds a connection handle to the physical instrument and has some sub-objects that represent the state of the physical instrument. These sub-objects are the `Parameters`. Writing a driver basically boils down to adding a ton of `Parameters`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What's a Parameter?\n",
    "\n",
    "A parameter represents a single value of a single feature of an instrument, e.g. the frequency of a function generator, the mode of a multimeter (resistance, current, or voltage), or the input impedance of an oscilloscope channel. Each `Parameter` can have the following attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `name`, the name used internally by QCoDeS, e.g. 'input_impedance'\n",
    "  * `instrument`, the instrument this parameter belongs to, if any.\n",
    "  * `label`, the label to use for plotting this parameter\n",
    "  * `unit`, the physical unit. ALWAYS use SI units if a unit is applicable\n",
    "  * `set_cmd`, the command to set the parameter. Either a SCPI string with a single '{}', or a function taking one argument (see examples below)\n",
    "  * `get_cmd`, the command to get the parameter. Follows the same scheme as `set_cmd`\n",
    "  * `vals`, a validator (from `qcodes.utils.validators`) to reject invalid values before they are sent to the instrument. Since there is no standard for how an instrument responds to an out-of-bound value (e.g. a 10 kHz function generator receiving 12e9 for its frequency), meaning that the user can expect anything from silent failure to the instrument breaking or suddenly outputting random noise, it is MUCH better to catch invalid values in software. Therefore, please provide a validator if at all possible.\n",
    "  * `val_mapping`, a dictionary mapping human-readable values like 'High Impedance' to the instrument's internal representation like '372'. Not always needed. If supplied, a validator is automatically constructed.\n",
    "  * `max_val_age`: Max time (in seconds) to trust a value stored in cache. If the parameter has not been set or measured more recently than this, an additional measurement will be performed in order to update the cached value. If it is ``None``, this behavior is disabled. ``max_val_age`` should not be used for a parameter that does not have a get function.\n",
    "  * `get_parser`, a parser of the raw return value. Since all VISA instruments return strings, but users usually want numbers, `int` and `float` are popular `get_parsers`\n",
    "  * `docstring` A short string describing the function of the parameter\n",
    "  \n",
    "Golden rule: if a `Parameter` is settable, it must always accept its own output as input.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adding a Parameter to an instrument.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two different ways of adding parameters to instruments. They are almost equivalent but comes with some trade-offs. We will show both below.\n",
    "Parameters are declared using the `add_parameter` method on the instrument class which takes care of creating the parameter and registering it as a member of the instrument. The output of this method call is the newly created Parameter. When possible we strongly encourage that this is assigned to an attribute of the same name on the instrument class as shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Explicitly assigning a parameter as an attribute on the instrument enables Sphinx, IDEs such as VSCode and static tools such as Mypy to detect the existence and type of the parameter.\n",
    "However if you parameter is created dynamically with a name that is not a string this may not be possible. E.g. if your parameters are created based on named defined in an external config file. In this case, it is acceptable to not assign the output of `add_parameter` to an attribute. To include the parameter in Sphinx documentation, you must also provide a docstring in the form `\"\"\"Docstring here\"\"\"` just below the call to `add_parameter`\n",
    "\n",
    "For historical reasons many instruments currently use `add_parameter` without assigning\n",
    "the output. QCoDeS provides a CLI tool `qcodes-refactor` to update such code automatically.\n",
    "The tool should be executed as `qcodes-refactor parameter_refactor path_to_folder_with_instrument_drivers_to_update`. You should carefully review the output of this tool and you may be required to add additional imports to make the code work correctly. To use\n",
    "this tool qcodes should be installed with the refactor option e.g. `pip install qcodes[refactor]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that it is also possible to directly create a parameter and assign it as an attribute. We do not recommend this, since you can easily forget that you are required to pass `instrument=self` to the parameter for the parameter to work correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to parameters QCoDeS instruments implement the concept of functions that can be added to the instrument via `add_function`. They are meant to implement simple actions on the instrument such as resetting it. However, the functions do not add any value over normal python methods in the driver Class and we are planning to eventually remove them from QCoDeS. **We therefore encourage any driver developer to not use function in any new driver**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What's an InstrumentModule, then?\n",
    "\n",
    "An `InstrumentModule` is a submodule of the instrument holding `Parameter`s. It sometimes makes sense to group `Parameter`s, for instance when an oscilloscope has four identical input channels (see Keithley example below)\n",
    "or when it makes sense to group a particular set of parameters into their own module (such as a trigger module containing trigger related settings) \n",
    "\n",
    "`InstrumentChannel` is a subclass of `InstrumentModule` which behaves identically to `InstrumentModule` you should chose either one depending on if you are implementing a module or a channel. As a rule of thumb you should use `InstrumentChannel` for something that the instrument has more than one of.\n"

    "## Naming Instruments \n",
    "\n",
    "We are aiming to organize drivers in QCoDeS in a consistent way for easy discovery.\n",
    "Note that not all drivers in QCoDeS are currently named consistently. \n",
    "However, we aim to gradually update all drivers to be named as outlined above and any new driver \n",
    "should be named in the way outlined below.\n",
    "\n",
    "The same rules should apply for QCoDeS-contrib-drivers with the exception that all drivers are stored in subfolders of the drivers folder. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Naming the Instrument class\n",
    "A driver for an instrument with model `Model` and from the vendor `Vendor` should be stored in the file:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "qcodes\\instrument_drivers\\{Vendor}\\{Vendor}_{Model}.py \n",
    "```\n",
    "using snake case with an underscore between the vendor and model name but starting the\n",
    "vendor name with upper case.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary instrument class should be named as follows:\n",
    "```\n",
    "class {Vendor}{Model}\n",
    "     ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "E.g Vendor followed by Model number in CamelCase.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we use vendor names starting with upper case for both folders and file names.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also fine to use an acronym for instrument vendors when there are well established. E.g. drivers for `American Magnetics Inc.` instruments\n",
    "may use the acronym `AMI` to refer to the vendor.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example the driver for the Weinschel 8320 should be stored in the file `qcodes\\instrument_drivers\\Weinschel\\Weinschel_8320.py` and the \n",
    "class named `Weinschel8320` \n",
    "\n",
    "### Naming InstrumentModule classes\n",
    "\n",
    "`InstrumentModule`s and `InstrumentChannel`s should be defined in the same file as the driver that they are part of. The classes should preferable be named such that it is clear\n",
    "from the name which instrument it belongs to. E.g a hypothetical `InstrumentChannel` belonging to a Weinschel 8320 should be named `Weinschel8320Channel` or similar.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Driver supporting multiple models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Often instrument vendors supply multiple instruments in a family with very similar specs only different in limits such as voltage ranges or \n",
    "highest supported frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example have a look at the Keysight 344xxA series of digital multi meters. To implement drivers for such instruments it is preferable\n",
    "to implement a private base class such as `_Keysight344xxA`. This class should be stored either in a `private` subfolder of the Vendor folder or\n",
    "in a file starting with an underscore i.e. `_Keysight344xxA.py`. If possible, we prefer a format where `x` is used to signal the parts of the model numbers that \n",
    "may change. Along with this class subclasses for each of the supported models should be implemented. These may either make small modifications to the baseclass as needed \n",
    "or be empty subclasses if no modifications are needed. \n",
    "\n",
    "E.g. subclasses of the Keysight 344xxA driver for the specific model `34410A` should be named as `Keysight34410A` and stored in `Keysight34410A.py`.\n",

    "## Logging\n",
    "Every QCoDeS module should have its own logger that is named with the name of the module. So to create a logger put a line at the top of the module like this:\n",
    "```\n",
    "log = logging.getLogger(__name__)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Use this logger only to log messages that are not originating from an `Instrument` instance. For messages from within an instrument instance use the `log` member of the `Instrument` class, e.g\n",
    "```\n",
    "self.log.info(f\"Could not connect at %s\", address)\n",
    "```\n",
    "This way the instrument name will be prepended to the log message and the log messages can be filtered according to the instrument they originate from. See the [example](../logging/logging_example.ipynb) notebook of the logger module for more info.\n",
    "\n",
    "When creating a nested `Instrument`, like e.g. something like the `InstrumentChannel` class, that has a `_parent` property, make sure that this property gets set before calling the `super().__init__` method, so that the full name of the instrument gets resolved correctly for the logging.\n"

Moreover, usually it is not easy to translate the lingo of the instrument to something that can have simply the value of `True` or `False` (which are typical in software). Even further, it may be difficult to find consensus between users on a convention: is it `on`/`off`, or `ON`/`OFF`, or python `True`/`False`, or `1`/`0`, or else?\n",
    "\n",
    "This case becomes even more complex if the instrument's API (say, corresponding VISA command) uses unexpected values for such a parameter, for example, turning an output \"on\" corresponds to a VISA command `DEV:CH:BLOCK 0` which means \"set blocking of the channel to 0 where 0 has the meaning of the boolean value False, and alltogether this command actually enables the output on this channel\".\n",

    "This results in inconsistency among instrument drivers where for some instrument, say, a `display` parameter has 'on'/'off' values for input, while for a different instrument a similar `display` parameter has `'ON'`/`'OFF'` values or `1`/`0`.\n",

The function takes care of creating a `val_mapping` dictionary that maps given instrument-side values of `on_val` and `off_val` to `True`/`False`, `'ON'`/`'OFF'`, `'on'`/`'off'`, and other commonly used ones. Note that when getting a value of such a parameter, the user will not get `'ON'` or `'off'` or `'oFF'` - instead, `True`/`False` will be returned."
