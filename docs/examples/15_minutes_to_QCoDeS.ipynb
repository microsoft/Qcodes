    "This short introduction is aimed for potential and new users to get the feel of the software. This is a fully functioning Jupyter notebook that will execute simple measurements using dummy instruments. Before you start with your first code using QCoDeS, make sure you have properly set up the Python environment as explained in [this document](../start/index.rst#installation). If you would like to follow this as an interactive notebook, you may [download it from github](https://github.com/QCoDeS/Qcodes/blob/master/docs/examples/15_minutes_to_QCoDeS.ipynb) to run on your local system, or you may use~ the \"launch binder\" link to use it via a web interface."

If you have any modifications, you should save the updated config file on your home directory or in the current working directory of your script/notebook. The QCoDeS config system first looks in the current directory for a config file and then in the home directory for one and only then - if no config files are found - it falls back to using the default one. The default config is located in `qcodes.config`. To know how to change and save the config please refer to the [documentation on config](Configuring_QCoDeS.ipynb)."
