            quiet (Optional[bool]): Set True to not print anything except
                errors. Default False.

            station (Optional[Station]): the ``Station`` this measurement
                pertains to. Defaults to ``Station.default`` if one is defined.
                Only used to supply metadata.

            use_threads (Optional[bool]): whether to parallelize ``get``

                automatic locations. If omitted, will use the default
                DataSet.location_provider

            name (Optional[str]): if location is default or another provider
                function, name is a string to add to location to make it more
                readable/meaningful to users

            formatter (Optional[Formatter]): knows how to read and write the
                file format. Default can be set in DataSet.default_formatter

            io (Optional[io_manager]): knows how to connect to the storage
                (disk vs cloud etc)
