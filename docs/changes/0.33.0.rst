QCoDeS 0.33.0 (2022-03-08)
==========================

New:
----

- Added a function ``qcodes.dataset.get_guids_by_run_spec`` to look up dataset guids
  from run specficiations. This replaces the now deprecated semi-public method
  ``get_guids_from_run_spec``. It has a better handling of connections and more filtering options matching
  ``load_by_run_spec``. (#3863)
- A new set of validators ``MultiTypeAnd`` and ``MultiTypeOr`` that allows combination of
  other validators with And and Or were added. For backwards compatibility the existing
  ``MultiType`` validator takes a ``combiner`` argument defaulting to Or. (#3917)


Improved:
---------

- Fixed a typo in legacy PyqtGraph plot preventing correct handling of custom units.
  Regression from 0.32.0 (#3773)
- The warning triggered when a parameter is added to the snapshot incorrectly has been improved to include the
  name of the full instrument and two levels of stack information. This should make it easier to find the
  problematic parameter. (#3884)
- Development versions of QCoDeS are now formatted as
  ``{version}.dev{distance}+{branch}{vcs}{rev}.dirty``
  e.g. ``0.32.0.dev14+name.of.branch.gxxxxx(.dirty)``
  rather than "{version}+{distance}.{vcs}{rev}". This is
  done since pip in some cases considers the later equal to the released
  version and include more info to let you easily identify the
  branch installed from. Note that due to limitations in characters
  in version numbers `/_-` are normalized to `.` e.g. a branch named
  ``myname/my_branch-name`` becomes `myname.my.branch.name` in the
  version number. (#3890)
- ``ChannelTuple`` now has a repr that correctly identifies it as a ``ChannelTuple``
  and not a ``ChannelList`` (#3911)
- ``Parameter.unit`` is now a settable property rather than an attribute.
  This should have few implications for user facing code but makes it possible
  to do the same in a parameter subclass implementing validation or other functionality
  as needed. (#3929)
- Metadata added after ``DataSet`` ``export`` to a netcdf file is now also added
  to that exported netcdf file (unless the exported netcdf file has been moved
  to a new location and ``set_netcdf_location`` was not called with that new
  location of the file) (#3932)
- In the interactive widget the total time of a run is now correctly calculated as
  end-time - start-time not the other way around. (#3944)
- Loading a 2 or higher dimentional qcodes dataset back from a netcdf file has been corrected to
  show the dataset in the correct shape.
  QCoDeS dataset are now always written to netcdf files from the cache with the same order of axis as in memory. (#3945)
- Datasets now correctly preserve the shape information when exported to another database. (#3956)
- Functions and classes marked deprecated with the QCoDes Deprecation decorator will now trigger
  warnings that reflect where they are called from and not the location of the deprecation decorator. (#3959)


Improved Drivers:
-----------------

- AMI430 3D magnet power supply driver: restore ramp rates of individual magnet
  axes after simultaneous ramp via calling ``wait_while_all_axes_ramping`` or
  automatically if ``block_during_ramp`` is ``True``. (#3885)
- Update the Keysight Infiniium oscilloscope driver to use ParameterWithSetpoints and also make the driver
  work without needing to run prepare_curvedata before measurement. Measurement subsystem is updated to be
  channel aware so it is possible to run measurements on multiple channels in a single qcodes measurement.
  For multiple traces, added the option to control automatic sweeping, similar to the N52xx driver. We can
  now take data from multiple channels with a single digitize. (#3916)
- Fix baud rate of QDevil and QDev QDac's to be 460800 (#3931)
- The Zurich instrument driver stubs in ``qcodes.instrument_drivers.zurich_instruments`` have been updated
  to use the 0.3 version of ``zhinst-qcodes`` (#3969)
- Fixed a typo that prevented initialization of Agilent 34400A (#3981)
