Introduction

This page explains the basics of the QCoDeS dataset. Read here to figure out what the heck is going on.

.. _sec:intro_basics:

Basics
======

The DataSet is directly linked to an SQLite database on the host machine's hard drive. Here we provide an overview of the layout of that database.
The specifics of the python objects implementing the API on top of that can be found in the section :ref:`datasetdesign`.

The database holds a number of ``Experiments`` that each holds a number of ``DataSets``. One ``DataSet`` contains exactly one ``run``, and we may use the words ``DataSet`` and ``run`` interchangeably.

.. _sec:intro_experiment:

Experiment
==========

The intended use of the ``Experiment`` is to group ``DataSets`` that belong together. For example, an experiment may contain all the measurements necessary to characterise a particular sample (Is it superconducting? What is the critical current?). Once the goodness of the sample has been established, a new experiment containing all the "real" measurements can then commence. The grouping runs this way is offered as a convenience and is as such not essential for any functionality in QCoDeS.

Each ``Experiment`` has the following attributes:

 * An experiment-ID
 * A name
 * A sample-name
 * A start time
 * (potentially) An end time

The **experiment-ID** is an ever-increasing integer enumerating the number of experiments in the current database. The experiments are kept in the SQLite database in the ``experiments`` table. The experiment-ID is the primary key of this table.

The **name** and the **sample name** of an experiment must be provided by the user at creation time.

The **start time** is automatically added upon creation, and the **end time** is added when (if ever) the user decides to mark the experiment as *completed* after which point no more runs may be added.

For an example notebook showing the useage of the database as a container for experiments, see the :doc:`Experiment Container Notebook <../examples/DataSet/The-Experiment-Container>`.


.. _sec:intro_dataset:

DataSet
=======

Each ``DataSet`` has the following attributes

  * A run-ID
  * An experiment-ID
  * A name
  * A table of results
  * A number of parameters
  * A start time
  * (potentially) An end time
  * A GUID

The **run-ID** is an ever-increasing integer enumerating the number of runs in the current database. The runs are kept in the SQLite database in the ``runs`` table. The run-ID is the primary key of this table.

The **experiment-ID** provides the link to the experiment that this dataset belongs to.

The **name** must be provided by the user at creation time.

The **table of results** is where the actual *data* of the ``DataSet`` resides. The table has a number of associated **parameters** as columns with data points as rows. The parameters may be QCoDeS ``Parameters``, but are not limited to that. The preferred procedure for associating parameters with a run and adding data is via the ``Measurement`` object as described in the :doc:`Measurement Object Example Notebook <../examples/DataSet/Dataset Context Manager>`. The deep thinking behind how different parameters relate to and depend on each other within a ``DataSet`` is explained in :ref:`interdependentparams`.

The **start time** is automatically added upon creation, and the **end time** is added when (if ever) the user decides to mark the run as *completed* after which point no more data points may be added.

The **GUID** is a run identifier that aims to go `beyond` the current database. The motivation for the GUID is that collaboration and data sharing across several machines requires a run to be labelled by something more than its name and number in the local database. The GUID is a standard 36 character string GUID composed from three integer codes and a timestamp. The codes are: location code (1-256), work station code (1-16777216), sample code (1-4294967296). The idea is that the people in a certain collaboration will label their locations, machines, and samples according to a scheme agreed upon `within` the relevant collaboration. That way, each run is uniquely identifiable in a human-readable way. This extra label for runs is offered as a convenience as is as such not essential for any functionality in QCoDeS.
