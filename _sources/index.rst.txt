QcoDeS is a Python-based data acquisition framework developed by the Copenhagen / Delft / Sydney / Microsoft quantum computing consortium.

The goal is a common framework for physics experiments, so:

- new students don't need to spend a long time learning software in order to
  participate in experiments
- one has to write their own code only for pieces that are very specific
  to their own experiment
- code can and should be contributed back to the framework
- the process of moving between teams or labs, and of setting up
  a new experiment is streamlined
- physics experiments can take advantage of modern software and best practices

Read `15 minutes to QcoDeS <examples/basic_examples/15_minutes_to_QCoDeS.ipynb>`_ to have quick overview on QCoDeS.
Many more elaborate examples can be found in the `example notebooks <examples/index.rst>`__.
