Exporting datasets to XArray no longer warns if two or more variables are exported with different setpoint names and/or values.
No functionality of the export has changed.
If the setpoints for different measured parameters have the same name, missing values will be replaced by NaN such that the
measured parameters have the same coordinates in XArray. If different setpoint names
are used, the exporter will automatically handle merging coordinates so each data variable is assigned its own coordinates.
