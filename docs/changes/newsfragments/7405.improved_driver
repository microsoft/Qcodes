Changes to Cryomagnetics 4G Driver

1. Added missing initialization of `self._RETRY_WRITE_ASK` and `self._RETRY_TIME` in the `write_raw` method to handle communication retries on VisaIOError.
2. Updated `set_field` to correctly recognize Standby as a valid final state when setting the magnetic field to 0â€¯T.
3. Modified `wait_while_ramping` to check the actual magnetic field value via `self._get_field()` instead of relying on the status byte, since the instrument may stay in the Ramping state even after reaching the target field.
4. Fixed unit parsing to handle unexpected trailing characters in the instrument's response. (e.g., "\r").
5. Fixed get_parser for `Vmag`, `Iout`, and `Vout` to remove units and return float.
6. Added timeout condition to `wait_while_ramping` to prevent infinite loop. Will trigger Exception if timeout occurs.
7. Fixed conversion calculations in `_set_rate` and `_get_rate`.
8. Added function `get_rates` to return rates for all ranges in Tesla/min as a dictionary.
9. Modified `_set_rate` to update all ranges (0-4) on the instrument (picks min value between set rate and maximum current limit for each range)
10. Add small sleep (0.1 seconds) between write calls during `max_current_limit` initialization.
11. Fixed/added unit tests to accurately reflect code changes.
12. Modified `set_field()` to allow users to control the strictness of `wait_while_ramping()` timeout condition (1e-4 was too precise and was triggering false timeouts).
