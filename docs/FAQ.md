### What are the different ways to run Loops, and when would you use them?

`Loop.run()` (or `ActiveLoop.run()`) has a two arguments that control where the loop runs and how the data is handled: `background` (`True` (default) or `False`) and `data_manager` (`None` (gets the default `DataManager`) or `False`).

- Default usage: `Loop.run()`:
  Involves two extra processes, one `<Measurement>` process that sequences the loop actions and a `<DataServer>` process that the `<Measurement>` feeds data to, then stores it to disk and provides it to other processes that want it. This is the normal way to run loops, because it minimizes the work done in the measurement process, so it runs as fast as possible, and also keeps the main process free for other tasks like live plotting and analysis.

- Foreground with a DataManager: `Loop.run(background=False)`:
  The measurement loop runs in the process that started it, rather than making a new process, so the starting process blocks until the loop is finished. You might do this to make debugging easier.

- Background with no DataManager: `Loop.run(data_manager=False)`:
  The measurement loop runs in the background, but does not start (or connect to, if one is started already) a `<DataServer>` process; instead, it holds and stores the data itself. If the main process wants to sync this data during acquisition, it will need to read it from disk. Not sure why you would use this mode, but it's possible.

- Foreground with no DataManager: `Loop.run(background=False, data_manager=False)`:
  No extra processes are involved; the measurement loop runs in the process that started it, and holds and saves the data itself. If you want to start another measurement loop while one is already running (for example if you have a complex parameter that runs its own measurement loop to determine some derived value), you need to use this mode. That's because only one background measurement is allowed at a time, and only one `DataSet` may be on the `<DataServer>` at a time. But this mode will still save the `DataSet` it makes; in most such complex parameter cases you want an even more stripped-down loop: `Loop.run_temp()` which just calls: `Loop.run(background=False, quiet=True, data_manager=False, location=False)` so it does not save anything, nor does it print the normal messages that `run` prints describing the `DataSet` it makes.

### How to abort a running measurement?

Use `qc.halt_bg()`. To list the active measurements use `qc.active_children()`
