A parameter `auto_freq_ref` was added to the `Keysight.N51x1` class.
From the Keysight manual:
This command enables or disables the ability of the signal generator to
automatically select between the internal and an external reference oscillator.

In addition, the val_mapping dictionary of the `rf_output` parameter is now using the `create_on_off_val_mapping` function.
