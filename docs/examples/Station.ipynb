    "Experimental setups are generally large as they consist of many instruments. Each instrument in a given setup tends to be quite complex due to the fact that each comprises a variety of adjustable parameters and other stateful parts. As a result, it deems useful to have a bucket in which the necessary information concerning the instruments that are going to be used in a particular experiment can be conveniently stored, and accessed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of a station, in essence, is a programmatical representation of such a bucket. Instruments, parameters, and other \"components\" can be added to a station. The user gets a station instance that can be referred to in order to access those \"components\".\n",

    "The instantiation of the instruments, setting up the proper initial values of the corresponding parameters and similar pre-specifications of a measurement constitutes the initialization portion of the code. In general, this portion can be quite long and tedious to maintain. For example, consider a case in which a certain instrument is no longer needed. In this case a common practice is commenting out the lines of initialization script which are related to the said instrument, and re-run the initialization script. The latter may easily cause a bloaded code with possible repetitions. In another case, we may want to share initialization scripts among collaborators and fail to do so as it is difficult due to the fact that even similar experiments may require different instantiations.\n",

    "\n",
    "A `Station` can be created with or without one or more YAML configuration files. With YAML configuration files, `Station` can be created by passing the file names (or file names with absolute path) to `Station`'s constructor. File names and location resolution also takes into account related entries in the `'station'` section of the QCoDeS configuration. We refer to corresponding documentation for more information.\n",

    "\n",
    "* `load_config_file` method can be used for loading 1 configuration file.\n",
    "* `load_config_files` method can be used for loading 1 or more configuration files. If multiple configuration files are provided, this method first merges them into one temporary file and then loads that into the station. Please note that, the merged file is temporary and not saved on the disk.\n",

    "In case the configuration is already available as a YAML string, then that configuration can be loaded using `Station`'s `load_config` method. We refer to it's docstring and signature for more information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the YAML configuration is loaded, the `load_instrument` method of the `Station` can be used to instantiate a particular instrument that is described in the YAML configuration. Calling this method not only will return an instance of the instantiated instrument, but will also add it to the station object.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, to instantiate the `qdac` instrument from the YAML configuration example from the previous section, it is sufficient to execute the following:\n",

    "\n",
    "There is a more convenient way to load the instruments. Upon load of the YAML configuration, convenient `load_<instrument name>` methods are being generated on the `Station` object. Users can make use of tab-completion in their development environments to list what instruments can be loaded by the station object from the loaded YAML configuration. For example, loading the QDac instrument can, alternatively, be done via:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "conveniently_loaded_qdac = station.load_qdac()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We note that instruments are instantiated only when `load_*` methods are called. This means that loading a YAML configuration does NOT automatically instantiate anything.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the instruments that are loaded with the `load_*` methods, it is recommended to use `Station`'s `close_and_remove_instrument` method for closing and removing those from the station."
