Changelog for QCoDeS 0.20.0
===========================

The November 2020 release of QCoDeS.

-----------------
Breaking Changes:
-----------------

- When performing a measurement with ``MultiParameter`` the parameters are now registered under their ``full_name`` including any instrument and channels that the parameter is bound to. This makes the ``MultiParameter`` consistent with all other parameters (#2317)
- The Keysight ``SD_common`` module is now deprecated in favour of the one in ``qcodes_contrib_drivers`` (#2395)
- The deprecated HP33210A driver has been removed (#2334)
- The deprecated Tektronix AWG5200 driver has been removed (#2335)
- Deprecated methods removed from ``DataSet`` (#2422)

----
New:
----
- The ``DataSet`` shape is used when loading data; this impacts the ``DataSet.get_parameter_data`` and ``DataSet.cache.data`` methods. See also `the measurement docs <https://qcodes.github.io/Qcodes/examples/DataSet/Performing-measurements-using-qcodes-parameters-and-dataset.html#Specifying-shape-of-measurement>`_ for more info on how data are loaded (#2264)
- The ``Measurement`` now captures exception info in the ``DataSet`` s metadata if an exception occured during measurement (#2327)
- There is now an explicit API for marking the ``cache`` of a ``Parameter`` as invalid (#2012)
- New support email introduced (#2366)

---------
Improved:
---------
- The documentation for ``ParameterWithSetpoints`` now shows how to make sweeps (#2351)
- Bugfix: calling ``mark_complete()`` on a completed ``DataSet`` no longer throws an exception (#2376)
- The documentation no longer references the legacy module (#2408)

------------
New drivers:
------------
- Keysight E4980A Precision LCR Meter (#2253)

-----------------
Improved drivers:
-----------------
- The Alazar drivers received various minor fixes (#2301)
- The Rohde & Schwarz ZNB vector network analyzer now supports CW readout mode (#2007)
- The Keithley 7510 now has a settable buffer name (#2370)
- Bugfix: Ithaco ``CurrentParameter`` (#2416)
- Keysight B1500 no longer has master/slave terminology in its API (#2423)
- Agilent E8527D now has a default terminator (#2434)
