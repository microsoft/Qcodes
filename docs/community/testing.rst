Notes on test runners compatible with Qcodes
============================================

There is now a test script `test.py <qcodes/test.py>`__ in the qcodes
directory that uses the standard ``unittest`` machinery to run all the
core tests (does not include instrument drivers). It has been tested on
Mac (terminal), and Windows (cmd, git bash, and PowerShell). It includes
coverage testing, but will only print a coverage report if tests pass.

The biggest difficulty with testing Qcodes is windows multiprocessing.
The spawn method restricts execution in ways that are annoying for
regular users (no class/function definitions in the notebook, no
closures) but seem to be completely incompatible with some test runners
(and/or coverage tracking)

I considered the following test runners: - **nose**: works well, but it
has a `note on its homepage <https://nose.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`__
that it is no longer being actively maintained (in favor of nose2
development), so we should not use it long-term.

-  **unittest**: the standard, built-in python tester. The only thing we
   really need to add to this is coverage testing, so now the question
   is what's the easiest way to do this? On Windows just using unittest
   wrapped in coverage fails.

-  **nose2**: has a broken coverage plugin - it reports all the
   unindented lines, ie everything # that executes on import, as
   uncovered - but can be used by wrapping it inside coverage instead,
   just like unittest.

-  **py.test**: seems to add lots of features, but it's not clear they
   are useful for us? Has a good coverage plugin but seems to require
   tons of command-line options. Requires both ``pytest`` and
   ``pytest-cov`` packages

on Mac terminal:

::

    # the following work with coverage:
    nosetests
    python setup.py nosetests
    py.test --cov-config .coveragerc --cov qcodes --cov-report term-missing
    coverage run -m nose2 && coverage report -m
    # both of these run unittest:
    coverage run setup.py test && coverage report -m
    coverage run -m unittest && coverage report -m

    # nose2's coverage plugin is broken - it reports all the unindented lines (everything
    # that executes on import) as uncovered
    nose2 -C --coverage-report term-missing

Windows cmd shell and git bash behave identically, PowerShell has
different chain syntax (commands with &&):

::

    # the following work with coverage:
    nosetests
    py.test --cov-config .coveragerc --cov qcodes --cov-report term-missing
    coverage run -m nose2 && coverage report -m  # cmd or bash
    (coverage run -m nose2) -and (coverage report -m)  # PowerShell

    # the following work without coverage:
    python -m unittest discover
    python -m unittest  # discover is unnecessary now, perhaps because I put test_suite in setup.py?

    # the following do not work:

    # fails on relative import in unittest inside separate process (why is it importing that anyway?)
    coverage run -m unittest discover && coverage report -m  # cmd or bash
    (coverage run -m unittest discover) -and (coverage report -m)  # PowerShell
    # these fail asking for freeze_support() but nothing I do with that seems to help
    python setup.py test
    coverage run setup.py test && coverage report -m  # cmd or bash
    (coverage run setup.py test) -and (coverage report -m)  # PowerShell
    python setup.py nosetests
