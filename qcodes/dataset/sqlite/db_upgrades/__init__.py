"""
This module provides infrastructure for upgrading schema and structure of
QCoDeS database. It also provides concreted upgrade functions between all
the database versions which exist so far.

The module contains :mod:`.version` module for working with the version of
QCoDeS databases.

If needed, this module may contain modules with upgrade-specific code. The
intention is to be able to decouple the code of the upgrade functions from
the current state of the SQLite API in QCoDeS (:mod:`.sqlite`). In
principle, the upgrade functions should not have dependecies from
:mod:`.queries` module.
