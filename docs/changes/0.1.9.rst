Changelog for QCoDeS 0.1.9
==========================

This release changes the API of Parameters in QCoDeS, reducing the amount of Parameter classes. It also introduces tests for VisaInstrument drivers via the PyVISA-sim backend.

Note: This is the last QCoDeS release before the new dataset and as such it will be the last QCoDeS release to support python 3.5.
