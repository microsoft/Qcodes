QCoDeS 0.51.0 (2025-02-14)
==========================

Breaking Changes:
-----------------

- The deprecated and non functional function `qcodes.test()` has been removed. (:pr:`6665`)


Improved:
---------

- ``DelegateParameter`` now includes validators of its source Parameter into its validators. This ensures that a ``DelegateParameter``
  with a non numeric source parameter is registered correctly in a measurement when the ``DelegateParameter`` it self does not
  set a validator. (:pr:`6585`)
- Fix a regression introduced in 0.50.0 where a DelegateParameter initialized with a None source
  would not correctly call get/set on the source parameter when this has been set. (:pr:`6671`)
- When passing ``bind_to_instrument=False`` to ``InstrumentBase.add_parameter`` a warning that
  recommends not doing this is now raised suggesting a better alternative.
  This replaces an existing inconsistent warning which was misleading. (:pr:`6722`)
- Only add magnet parameters if a magnet is detected in the Oxford Triton driver. (:pr:`6792`)


Improved Drivers:
-----------------

- Enabled use of ZNLE R&S VNA by recognizing the model name in RohdeSchwarzZNBBase, and creating an ZNLE## class as an alias (:pr:`6796`)
