QCoDeS 0.50.0 (2024-11-22)
==========================

Breaking Changes:
-----------------

- QCoDeS no longer attempts to automatically disable Sypders User module reloader (UMR).
  The code was no longer working correctly with the latest version of Spyder and is not
  maintainable since Spyder does not have a public api to disable UMR. If you use
  QCoDeS from an editable install it is strongly recommended to disable UMR for QCoDeS.
  See :ref:`gettingstarted` for more details. (:pr:`6647`)


Improved:
---------

- Improves the DataSetDefinition class to allow users to specify metadata to be added to the resulting dataset (:pr:`6643`)
- DelegateParameter now reads delegated properties from source rather than setting them at source change.
  This resolves an issue when delegating from another delegate parameter may result in incorrect attributes. (:pr:`6648`)


New:
----

- Added a new feature to find links in a parameter chain by parameter type (:pr:`6599`)
- Added new methods to find instruments in a parameter chain by parameter type (:pr:`6616`)
