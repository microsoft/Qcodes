"""
Data acquisition loops

The general scheme is:

1. create a (potentially nested) Loop, which defines the sweep
    setpoints and delays
2. activate the loop (which changes it to an ActiveLoop object),
    or omit this step to use the default measurement as given by the
    Loop.set_measurement class method.
3. run it with the .run method, which creates a DataSet to hold the data,
    and defines how and where to save the data.

Some examples:

    # set default measurements for later Loop's to use
    Loop.set_measurement(param1, param2, param3)

    # 1D sweep, using the default measurement set
    Loop(sweep_values, delay).run()

    # 2D sweep, using the default measurement set
    # sv1 is the outer loop, sv2 is the inner.
    Loop(sv1, delay1).loop(sv2, delay2).run()

    # 1D sweep with specific measurements to take at each point
    Loop(sv, delay).each(param4, param5).run()

    # Multidimensional sweep: 1D measurement of param6 on the outer loop,
    # and the default measurements in a 2D loop
    Loop(sv1, delay).each(param6, Loop(sv2, delay)).run()

Supported actions (args to .set_measurement or .each) are:
    Parameter: anything with a .get method and .name or .names
        see parameter.py for options
    ActiveLoop (or Loop, will be activated with default measurement)
    Task: any callable that does not generate data
    Wait: a delay

            May be a callable to provide automatic locations. If omitted, will
            use the default DataSet.location_provider
        name: if location is default or another provider function, name is
            a string to add to location to make it more readable/meaningful
            to users
        formatter: knows how to read and write the file format
            default can be set in DataSet.default_formatter
        io: knows how to connect to the storage (disk vs cloud etc)
        write_period: how often to save to storage during the loop.
            default 5 sec, use None to write only at the end
