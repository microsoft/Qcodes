Qcodes is a Python-based data acquisition framework developed by the Copenhagen / Delft / Sydney / Microsoft quantum computing consortium.

The goal is a common framework for physics experiments, so:

- new students don't need to spend a long time learning software in order to
  participate in experiments
- one has to write their own code only for pieces that are very specific
  to their own experiment
- code can and should be contributed back to the framework
- the process of moving between teams or labs, and of setting up
  a new experiment is streamlined
- physics experiments can take advantage of modern software and best practices


See how easy it is to run for yourself:

.. code:: python

   # imports
   import qcodes as qc
   from qcodes.tests.instrument_mocks import DummyInstrument

   # instantiate two dummy instruments
   # That would be your actual instruments in your application
   mock_dac = DummyInstrument('mock_dac', gates=['ch1', 'ch2'])
   mock_dmm = DummyInstrument('mock_dmm', gates=['v1', 'v2'])

   # optionally (but do it) put the instruments in a station
   station = qc.Station(mock_dac, mock_dmm)

   # define a measurement...
   loop = qc.Loop(mock_dac.ch1.sweep(0, 1, 0.05), 0).each(mock_dmm.v1)

   # ...run it!
   loop.run()

Many more elaborate examples can be found in the example notebooks.
