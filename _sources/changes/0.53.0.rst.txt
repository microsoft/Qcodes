QCoDeS 0.53.0 (2025-06-16)
==========================

Breaking Changes:
-----------------

- QCoDeS has dropped support for python 3.10. QCoDeS now supports Python 3.11, 3.12 and 3.13. (:pr:`7038`)
- The deprecated aliases to Lakeshore modules in `qcodes.instrument_drivers.Lakeshore.lakeshore_base` have been removed.
  The aliases to lakeshore drivers in `qcodes.instrument_drivers.Lakeshore.Model_325`, `qcodes.instrument_drivers.Lakeshore.Model_336` and `qcodes.instrument_drivers.Lakeshore.Model_372`
  have been removed. Please make sure that all Lakeshore related imports are from `qcodes.instrument_drivers.Lakeshore` avoiding any submodules. (:pr:`7187`)


Improved:
---------

- The implementation of ``do0d`` and ``do1d`` have been replaced with a wrapper around `dond`.
  This aligns the keyword arguments with ``dond`` and ensures that these function support
  the same features as ``dond``. The same change is planned for ``do2d`` in the future. (:pr:`7065`)
- `InstrumentLoggerAdapter` now merges the extra dict from the log record with information
  inserted by the LoggerAdapter. This makes it possible to add additional information to a
  log message logged via the instruments log attribute e.g. `myinst.visa_log.info("message", extra={"this": "that"})` (:pr:`7186`)
- `qcodes.dataset.descriptions.detect_shapes` and `qcodes.dataset.dond.do_nd_utils` have been updated
  to use `parameter.register_name` when creating shape dictionaries for storage in the dataset

  Previously, these methods used `parameter.full_name` which could result in shapes not being stored
  or used correctly for parameters that use `parameter.register_name`

  closes #7198 (:pr:`7199`)


Improved Drivers:
-----------------

- The Keysight 344xxA drivers have been updated to ensure that ``NPLC``, ``autorange``, ``autozero``, ``apature_time`` and ```apature_mode``
  parameters use the correct instrument commends for the sense mode selected by the ``sense_function`` parameter. (:pr:`6723`)


New:
----

- ``InstrumentBase.add_submodule`` now returns the added submodule. This similar to changes made in ``add_parameter`` earlier.
  This makes it possible to assign this to an attribute which enables static code checkers, IDEs and documentation to
  discover submodules. The ``Galil`` drivers have been updated to make use of this. Consult the ``Galil`` driver or ``Creating-Instrument-Drivers``
  notebook for examples of how to use this. It is planed that QCoDeS in the future will ship with a tool to automatically perform this refactor
  and updates to all included drivers. (:pr:`7017`)
