Add a callback to ``dataset.get_parameter_data``.
This is usefull to track the progress of the data download.
Since sqlite3 does not allow to keep track of the data loading progress,
we compute how many sqlite requests correspond to a certain percentage of
progress which is dictated by a config parameter "callback_percent".
Then we perform x sql request instead of one, running the callback everytime.
