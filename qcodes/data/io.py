'''
IO managers for QCodes

IO managers wrap whatever physical storage layer the user wants to use
in an interface mimicking the built-in <open> context manager, with
some restrictions to minimize the overhead in creating new IO managers.

The main thing these managers need to implement is the open context manager:
- Only the context manager needs to be implemented, not separate
  open function and close methods.

- open takes the standard parameters:
    filename: (string)
    mode: (string) only 'r' (read), 'w' (write), and 'a' (append) are
        expected to be implemented. As with normal file objects, the only
        difference between write and append is that write empties the file
        before adding new data, and append leaves the existing contents in
        place but starts writing at the end.

- the file-like object returned should implement a minimal set of operations.

  In read mode:
    read([size]): read to the end or at most size bytes into a string
    readline([size]): read until a newline or up to size bytes, into a string
    iter(): usually return self, but can be any iterator over lines
    next(): assuming iter() returns self, this yields the next line.
    (note: iter and next can be constructed automatically by FileWrapper
     if you implement readline.)

  In write or append mode:
    write(s): add string s to the end of the file.
    writelines(seq): add a sequence of strings (can be constructed
        automatically if you use FileWrapper)

IO managers should also implement:
- a join method, ala os.path.join(*args).
- a list method, that returns all objects matching location
- a remove method, ala os.remove(path) except that it will remove directories
    as well as files, since we're allowing "locations" to be directories
    or files.
