QCoDeS 0.49.0 (2024-10-15)
==========================

Breaking Changes:
-----------------

- The methods `get`, `set`, `call` and `__getitem__` on the `InstrumentBase` class have been deprecated.
  Parameters can be looked up by name using the `Instrument.parameters` dict and functions using `instrument.functions`
  which is cleaner and fully equivalent. (:pr:`6086`)
- The deprecated `qcodes.tests` module has been removed. Mock instruments can be found in `qcodes.instrument_drivers.mock_instruments` and
  DriverTestCase as `qcodes.extensions.DriverTestCase`. (:pr:`6480`)


Improved:
---------

- The deprecated support for enabling OpenCensus based telemetry has been removed.
  QCoDeS will now warn if you try to enable OpenCensus based telemetry in the config.
  Users are encouraged to roll out their own telemetry solution if they need it based
  on OpenTelemetry. This also means that the `qcodes[opencensus]` install target has been removed.
  The unused method `filter_out_telemetry_log_records` has been deprecated and will be removed in a future release. (:pr:`6439`)
- Parameters registered in a qcodes Measurement are now snapshotted and stored in the resulting dataset under `dataset.snapshot["parameters"]` (:pr:`6487`)
- Group parmeter now accepts a callable that returns a string command as its ``get_cmd``.
  This is useful for the cases where the command string is dynamic; for example,
  ``lambda: f"CMD {get_id_that_specifies_the_command()} ?"``. (:pr:`6520`)


Improved Drivers:
-----------------

- LakeShore335: Fix typo in setpoint_ramp parameter group (:pr:`6430`)
- Add curve header parameters to Lakeshore model 336 that allows query of the input channel curve header.
  This is useful to verify remotely if the correct temperature calibration curve is selected. (:pr:`6520`)
- Fix Rigol DG4000 value mappings for ``output_polarity`` parameters. (:pr:`6345`)
