QCoDeS is currently available only within the Microsoft Station Q collaboration and by specific private arrangement with a beta test group. Please do not share it with anyone who is not part of the beta test program. If you have a coworker who would like access, please contact Alex Johnson (alex.johnson@nbi.ku.dk) to see if they can be added to the program.

Please report all bugs, limitations, or missing functionality as issues on the Qcodes GitHub.

We encourage you to contribute any bug fixes or new functionality you develop, especially device drivers, by creating a GitHub branch and submitting a pull request. Note that any code you contribute may be included in the public open source release of QCoDeS.

We intend to release it as open source software once it is robust and reasonably stable, under the following license terms:
