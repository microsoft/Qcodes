    "## TL;DR\n",
    " * There is a QCoDeS logging module: `qcodes.utils.logger`\n",
    " * Call `logger.start_all_logging` at the start of every script/session to make sure all log messages get stored to the `.qcodes/logs` folder in your home directory, or set `logger.start_logging_on_import` to `True` in your `qcodesrc.json` configuration.\n",
    " * For debugging purposes you can log messages of an individual instrument (and see the VISA dialog).\n",
    " * You can obtain all logging messages in a `pandas.DataFrame` for further analysis."

    "## Introduction\n",
    "Python offers an excellent logging framework that is widely used in QCoDeS. As a user, you might be interested in reading the log messages that are generated by QCoDeS for debugging and also profiling purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "All log records(i.e., messages and metadata) are created using a python `logging.logger` object. In QCoDeS there is a logger for every module with the same name as the module itself, i.e., you can use `logging.getLogger('qcodes.instrument.base')` for getting the logger of the QCoDeS `Instrument`. From the dots in the names of the loggers a hierarchy is defined, at the top of which is the so called *root logger* that catches all messages.\n",
    "The log records created in a logger are processed by the *handlers* that have been attached to this specific *logger*.\n",
    "The handlers can, for example, be used to output the log messages into different locations, like the console or a log file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every logger, handler and log record has an associated level. The default levels are: `CRITICAL`, `ERROR`, `WARNING`, `INFO` and `DEBUG`. The levels determine how messages are passed: a logger passes only records that exceeds its minimal passing level to its handlers and the handlers in turn only output those messages that exceed their minimal passing level.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For a more detailed description of Python logging refer to the [official manual](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/logging.html#module-logging) (This is all well summed up [in this chart](https://docs.python.org/3.6/howto/logging.html#logging-flow))"

    "## Instrument communication loggers\n",
    "Not all the used loggers in QCoDeS follow the previously presented rule of naming the logger after the module. For instruments there are the following loggers:\n",
    " - **qcodes.instrument.base.com**:\n",
    "   This logger logs all the communication of the `Instrument` and its descendants with the actual physical instruments, e.g.,  the messages generated by the `write` and `query` calls.\n",
    " - **qcodes.instrument.base.com.visa**:\n",
    "  This is a sublogger that logs all the communication related messages of the `VisaInstrument` and its descendants."

    "### QCoDeS default handlers\n",
    "The effect of the console handler can be seen in the two printed lines with a red background below the previous code cell. Every line corresponds to a log record. The fields of the records are separated by `¦` and have the following meaning:\n",
    " 0. time stamp\n",
    " 1. logger name, here the module name\n",
    " 2. record log level\n",
    " 3. name of the function that created the log message\n",
    " 4. line at which the message has been issued\n",
    " 5. actual log message\n",
    "\n",
    "The same format is used for the file handler. By default QCoDeS logs to the file `<user directory>/.qcodes/logs/qcodes.log`. To avoid endlessly long files, the files roll over at midnight and get the date appended to their name where `qcodes.log` without date always gives you the log messages of the same day.\n",
    "\n",
    "To configure the levels you want to log/handle, you need to edit the `qcodesrc.json` file in you home directory. The default values are:\n",
    "```\n",
    "    \"logger\":{\n",
    "        \"console_level\": \"WARNING\",\n",
    "        \"file_level\": \"INFO\",\n",
    "        \"logger_levels\":{\n",
    "            \"pyvisa\": \"INFO\"\n",
    "        }\n",
    "```\n",
    "While `console_level` and `file_level` describe the levels of the two default handlers described previously, `logger_levels` is a dictionary that can be used to limit the messages passed on by module level loggers. This means with these defaults, the `pyvisa` module will not log messages on a `DEBUG` level. Therefore setting the `console_level` to `DEBUG` will not show the `pyvisa` debug messages (you certainly don't want to see them as they log every single character that is passed to an instrument with an individual message). On the other hand setting the console level to warning will still suppress `pyvisa` info messages. "
