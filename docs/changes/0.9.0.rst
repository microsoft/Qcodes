* Setting ``Parameter.raw_value`` (for example ``p.raw_value = 2``) is
  deprecated because it can lead to inconsistent state of the parameter.
  Use ``Parameter.set`` or ``Parameter.cache.set`` methods instead. (#1857)
* Private method ``Parameter._save_val`` that has been spotted in use in
  instrument drivers is deprecated now. Use ``Parameter.set`` and
  ``Parameter.cache.set`` methods instead. (#1858)
