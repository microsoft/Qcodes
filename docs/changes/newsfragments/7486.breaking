``ChannelTuple/ChannelList.get_channel_by_name`` support for getting more than one channel has been deprecated. To get more than one channel use ``get_channels_by_name``.
``get_channels_by_name`` is guaranteed to always return an instance of the class it was called on independently of the number of channels supplied. In the future
``get_channel_by_name`` will be updated to ensure that it always returns a single channel.
