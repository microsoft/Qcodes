Requirements
------------

You need a working python 3.x installation to be able to use QCoDeS. We highly
recommend installing Anaconda, which takes care of installing Python and
managing packages. In the following it will be assumed that you use Anaconda.
Download and install it from `here <https://www.anaconda.com/download>`_. Make
sure to download the latest version with python 3.6.

Once you download, install Anaconda according to the instructions on screen,
choosing the single user installation option.

The next section will guide you through the installation of QCoDeS
on Windows, although most of the things also work for macOS and Linux.

Installation
------------
Before you install QCoDeS you have to decide whether you want to install the
latest stable release or if you want to get the developer version from GitHub.

Installing the latest QCoDeS release
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
First download the QCoDeS environment.yml file by right
clicking on `this link <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/QCoDeS/Qcodes/master/environment.yml>`__
and select save link as and download the file to a location
that you can find again.
Next launch an Anaconda Prompt (start typing anaconda in the start menu and
click on *Anaconda Prompt*).

Here type in the prompt:

.. code:: bash

    conda env create -f environment.yml
    activate qcodes
    pip install qcodes

The first line creates a new anaconda environment that is called *qcodes*
and will install all the required dependendencies. The second line activates
this freshly created environment, so that the command in the third line will
install qcodes for this environment.

Installing QCoDeS from GitHub
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Clone the QCoDeS repository from GitHub from https://github.com/QCoDeS/Qcodes
Then create an environment, that contains all of the dependencies for QCoDeS,
from the *environment.yml* file in the root of the repository and activate it:

.. code:: bash

    conda env create -f <path-to-environment.yml>
    activate qcodes

Finally install QCoDeS add the repository via

.. code:: bash

    pip install -e <path-to-repository>


Using QCoDes
------------
For using QCoDeS, as with any other python library, it is useful to use an
application that facilitates the editing and execution of python files. With
Anaconda there come two preinstalled options:

 * **Jupyter**, a browser based notebook
 * **Spyder**, an integrated development environment

To start either of them you can use the shortcuts in the start menu under
*Anaconda3* with a trailing *(qcodes)*.

For other options you can launch a terminal either via the *Anaconda Navigator*
by selecting *qcodes* in the *Environments tab* and left-clicking on the *play*
button or by entering

.. code:: bash

    activate qcodes

in the *Anaconda prompt*

From the terminal you can then start any other application, such as *IPython* or
just plain old *Python*.
