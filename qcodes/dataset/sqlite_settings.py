    Function to read the local SQLite settings at import time.

    when committing large amounts of data to the DB, but we record
    everything for good measures.

        Two dictionaries, one with the limits, one with all other settings.
        If a setting has a value, that value is provided. Else a boolean
        indicating wether SQLite was compiled with that option. A missing
        option, say, 'FOOBAR' is equivalent to {'FOOBAR': False}.
