``ChannelList`` and ``AutoLoadableChannelList`` can now correctly infer the type of channels in the list
when indexed using ``__get_item`` e.g. ``mychannellist[0]`` For consistency with the base classes the parent type
in  ``AutoLoadableChannelList`` has changed from ``Instrument`` to ``InstrumentBase`` which may require downstream
changes for type checking to work correctly.
