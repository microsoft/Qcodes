Exporting datasets to XArray no longer warns if two or more variables are exported with different setpoints.
No functionality of the export has changed
If the setpoints have the same name missing values will be replaced by NaN and if different setpoints
are used the exporter will automatically handle merging coordinates so each data variable is assigned its own coordinates.
