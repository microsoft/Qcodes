    "# Creating Simulated PyVISA Instruments\n",
    "\n",
    "When developing stuff in a large codebase like QCoDeS, it is often uncanningly easy to submit a change that breaks stuff. Therefore, _continuous integration_ is performed in the form of automated tests that run before new code is allowed into the codebase. The many tests of QCoDeS can be found in `qcodes.tests`. \n",
    "\n",
    "But how about drivers? They constitute the majority of the codebase, but how can we test them? Wouldn't that require a physical copy each instrument to be present on the California server where we run our tests? It used to be so, but not anymore! For drivers utilising PyVISA (i.e. `VisaInstrument` drivers), we may create simulated instruments to which the drivers may connect.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What?\n",
    "\n",
    "This way, we may instantiate drivers and run simple tests on them. Tests like:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Can the driver even instantiate? This is very relevant when underlying APIs change.\n",
    "  * Is the drivers (e.g.) \"voltage-to-bytecode\" converter working properly?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Not!\n",
    "\n",
    "It is not feasible to simulate any but the most trivial features of the instrument. Simulated instruments can not and should not perform tests like:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Do we wait sufficiently long for this oscilloscope's trace to be acquired?\n",
    "  * Does our driver handle overlapping commands of this AWG correctly?\n",
    "  \n",
    "## How?\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic scheme goes as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Write a `.yaml` file for the simulated instrument. The instructions for that may be found here: https://pyvisa-sim.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ and specifically here: https://pyvisa-sim.readthedocs.io/en/latest/definitions.html#definitions\n",
    "  * Then write a test for your instrument and put it in `qcodes/tests/drivers`. The file should have the name `test_<nameofyourdriver>.py`. \n",
    "  * Check that all is well by running `$ pytest test_<nameofyourdriver>.py`.\n",
    "  \n",
    "Below is an example.\n"
