"""
Data acquisition loops.

The general scheme is:

1. create a (potentially nested) Loop, which defines the sweep setpoints and
delays

2. activate the loop (which changes it to an ActiveLoop object),
or omit this step to use the default measurement as given by the
Loop.set_measurement class method.

3. run it with the .run method, which creates a DataSet to hold the data,
and defines how and where to save the data.

Some examples:

- set default measurements for later Loop's to use

>>> Loop.set_measurement(param1, param2, param3)

- 1D sweep, using the default measurement set

>>> Loop(sweep_values, delay).run()

- 2D sweep, using the default measurement set sv1 is the outer loop, sv2 is the
  inner.

>>> Loop(sv1, delay1).loop(sv2, delay2).run()

- 1D sweep with specific measurements to take at each point

>>> Loop(sv, delay).each(param4, param5).run()

- Multidimensional sweep: 1D measurement of param6 on the outer loop, and the
  default measurements in a 2D loop

>>> Loop(sv1, delay).each(param6, Loop(sv2, delay)).run()

Supported commands to .set_measurement or .each are:

    - Parameter: anything with a .get method and .name or .names see
      parameter.py for options
    - ActiveLoop (or Loop, will be activated with default measurement)
    - Task: any callable that does not generate data
    - Wait: a delay
