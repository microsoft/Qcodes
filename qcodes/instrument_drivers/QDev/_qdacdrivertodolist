The instrument inherits from VisaInstrument (is this clever?), which implicitly assumes the instrument
to speak SCPI.

Okay, so, *IDN? is a VISA string? And even Instrument assumes this...

*IDN? is specified already in IEEE 488.2

This leads to broken functions in the API, unless we override all inherited SCPI-dependent
functions.
