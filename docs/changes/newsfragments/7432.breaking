The method ``to_xarray_dataarray_dict`` on the classes ``DataSet`` and ``DataSetInMem``
have been deprecated and replaced by ``to_xarray_dataset_dict``. This new method allows
export of datasets that still only contain one measured parameter but can contain
related coordinates such as these given by an inferred relationship.
