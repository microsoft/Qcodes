# This module provides a class to make an IPInstrument behave like a
# VisaInstrument. This is only meant for use with the PyVISA-sim backend
# for testing purposes. If you really need an IPInstrument to become
# a VisaInstrument for actual instrument control, please rewrite the driver.

# At the end of the module, a 'zoo' of was-ip-is-now-visa drivers can be found.
# Such a driver is just a two-line class definition.

    """
    Class to inject an VisaInstrument like behaviour in an
    IPInstrument that we'd like to use as a VISAInstrument with the
    simulation back-end.
    The idea is to inject this class just before the IPInstrument in
    the MRO. To avoid IPInstrument to ever take any effect, we sidestep
    it during the __init__ by calling directly to Instrument (which then
    class up through the chain) and explicitly reimplementing the __init__
    of VisaInstrument. We also must reimplement close, as that method
    calls super.

    Only meant for testing/simulation purposes!
    Do not use this for actual instrument control, there could be many
    nasty surprises.
