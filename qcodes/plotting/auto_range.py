    Get the min and max range of the provided array that excludes outliers
    following the IQR rule.

    This function computes the inter-quartile-range (IQR), defined by Q3-Q1,
    i.e. the percentiles for 75% and 25% of the distribution. The region
    without outliers is defined by [Q1-1.5*IQR, Q3+1.5*IQR].

    Args:
        data_array: Numpy array of arbitrary dimension containing the
            statistical data.
        cutoff_percentile: Percentile of data that may maximally be clipped
            on both sides of the distribution.
            If given a tuple (a,b) the percentile limits will be a and 100-b.
