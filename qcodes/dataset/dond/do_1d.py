    Perform a 1D scan of ``param_set`` from ``start`` to ``stop`` in
    ``num_points`` measuring param_meas at each step. In case param_meas is
    an ArrayParameter this is effectively a 2d scan.

    Args:
        param_set: The QCoDeS parameter to sweep over
        start: Starting point of sweep
        stop: End point of sweep
        num_points: Number of points in sweep
        delay: Delay after setting parameter before measurement is performed
        param_meas: Parameter(s) to measure at each step or functions that
          will be called at each step. The function should take no arguments.
          The parameters and functions are called in the order they are
          supplied.
        enter_actions: A list of functions taking no arguments that will be
            called before the measurements start
        exit_actions: A list of functions taking no arguments that will be
            called after the measurements ends
        write_period: The time after which the data is actually written to the
            database.
        additional_setpoints: A list of setpoint parameters to be registered in
            the measurement but not scanned.
        measurement_name: Name of the measurement. This will be passed down to
            the dataset produced by the measurement. If not given, a default
            value of 'results' is used for the dataset.
        exp: The experiment to use for this measurement.
        do_plot: should png and pdf versions of the images be saved after the
            run. If None the setting will be read from ``qcodesrc.json``
        use_threads: If True measurements from each instrument will be done on
            separate threads. If you are measuring from several instruments
            this may give a significant speedup.
        show_progress: should a progress bar be displayed during the
            measurement. If None the setting will be read from ``qcodesrc.json``
        log_info: Message that is logged during the measurement. If None a default
            message is used.
        break_condition: Callable that takes no arguments. If returned True,
            measurement is interrupted.

    Returns:
        The QCoDeS dataset.
