Changelog for QCoDeS 0.23.0
===========================

The February 2021 release of QCoDeS.

---------
Improved:
---------

- Commit data directy to dataset cache (#2667) (#2761)
- Removed duplicate get call in ``_ParamCaller`` used to acquire
  parameters out of the main thread. This fix resulting in a 2x speed up for multi-threaded experiments (#2712)
- Add ``pandas`` and ``xarray`` methods to ``DataSetCache``  matching the ``DataSet`` (#2763)
- Fix to Avoid loading data twice in dataset's ``to_xarray_dataset`` method (#2762)
- Add optional ``tqdm`` progress bar to ``doNd`` functions (#2734)
- Improvment to ``Station`` by adding the ``load_all_instruments`` method to load everything specified
  in configuration yaml (#2721) (#2754)
- In ``guid_helpers`` the regular expression used to read guids from a string represantation of a
  list/tuple of guids was flawed. Improvment to use ``ast.parse`` makes it a lot easier and error proof. (#2700)
- Fix for station snapshot of parameters with ``snapshot_exclude`` (#2692)


------------
New drivers:
------------

- AWG Driver for the Keysight ``M9336A`` PXIe I/Q Arbitrary Waveform Generator. This driver provides
  a simple wrapper around the IVI-C drivers from Keysight (#2613)
- Driver wrapper for the Keysight ``M960X`` DAC. This driver provides an interface into the IVI-C driver
  provided by Keysight (#2613)


-----------------
Improved drivers:
-----------------

- Feature to determine the frequency and power parameter validators on the Agilent ``E8527D`` microwave
  source based on the installed options (#2690)


---------------
Under the hood:
---------------

- Remove dependency on gitpython (#2738)
- Add two more SMUs to B1500 yaml sim file, useful for testing (#2722)
- Modernize packaging by moving most static packaging data to ``setup.cfg`` (#2693)
- Remove left over usage of deprecated ``get_data_as_pandas_dataframe`` (#2674)
