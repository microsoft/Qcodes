The ``ChannelTuple`` class now has ``multi_parameter`` and ``multi_function`` methods that
provide type-safe access to parameters and functions on all channels in the tuple. These methods
allow accessing attributes with proper type information, improving IDE integration and type checking.
The return type annotation of ``__getattr__`` has been changed to ``Any`` reflecting the fact that
this is not a type safe interface and it is impossible for a static type checker to infer the type
of the dynamic attribute. ``multi_parameter``, ``multi_function`` and ``get_channel_by_name`` should
be used when a more specific type is requested.
