class MockInstrument(Instrument):

    """
    Create a software instrument, mostly for testing purposes.

    Also works for simulations, but usually this will be simpler, easier to
    use, and faster if made as a single ``Instrument`` subclass.

    ``MockInstrument``\s have extra overhead as they serialize all commands
    (to mimic a network communication channel) and use at least two processes
    (instrument server and model server) both of which must be involved in any
    given query.

    parameters to pass to model should be declared with:

        - get_cmd = param_name + '?'
        - set_cmd = param_name + ':{:.3f}' (specify the format & precision)

    alternatively independent set/get functions may still be provided.

    Args:
        name (str): The name of this instrument.

        delay (number): Time (in seconds) to wait after any operation
            to simulate communication delay. Default 0.

        model (MockModel): A model to connect to. Subclasses MUST accept
            ``model`` as a constructor kwarg ONLY, even though it is required.
            See notes in ``Instrument`` docstring.
            The model should have one or two methods related directly to this
            instrument by ``name``:
            ``<name>_set(param, value)``: set a parameter on the model
            ``<name>_get(param)``: returns the value of a parameter

        keep_history (bool): Whether to record (in self.history) every command
            sent to this instrument. Default True.

        server_name (Union[str, None]): leave default ('') to make a
            MockInsts-####### server with the number matching the model server
            id, or set None to not use a server.

    Attributes:
        shared_kwargs (List[str]): Class attribute, constructor kwargs to
            provide via server init. For MockInstrument this should always be
            ['model'] at least.

        keep_history (bool): Whether to record all commands and responses. Set
            on init, but may be changed at any time.

        history (List[tuple]): All commands and responses while keep_history is
            enabled, as tuples:
            (timestamp, 'ask' or 'write', param_name[, value])

class MockModel(ServerManager, BaseServer):  # pragma: no cover

    """
    Base class for models to connect to various MockInstruments.

    Creates a separate process that holds the model state, so that
    any process can interact with the model and get the same state.

    Args:
        name (str): The server name to create for the model.
            Default 'Model-{:.7s}' uses the first 7 characters of
            the server's uuid.

    for every instrument that connects to this model, create two methods:
        - ``<instrument>_set(param, value)``: set a parameter on the model
        - ``<instrument>_get(param)``: returns the value of a parameter
          ``param`` and the set/return values should all be strings

    If ``param`` and/or ``value`` is not recognized, the method should raise
    an error.

    Other uses of ServerManager use separate classes for the server and its
    manager, but here I put the two together into a single class, to make it
    easier to define models. The downside is you have a local object with
    methods you shouldn't call: the extras (<instrument>_(set|get)) should
    only be called on the server copy. Normally this should only be called via
    the attached instruments anyway.

    The model supports ``NestedAttrAccess`` calls ``getattr``, ``setattr``,
    ``callattr``, and ``delattr`` Because the manager and server are the same
    object, we override these methods with proxy methods after the server has
    been started.
