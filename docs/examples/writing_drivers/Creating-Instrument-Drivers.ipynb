    "\n",
    "There are 3 available:\n",
    "- `VisaInstrument` - for most instruments that communicate over a text channel (ethernet, GPIB, serial, USB...) that do not have a custom DLL or other driver to manage low-level commands.\n",
    "- `IPInstrument` - a deprecated driver just for ethernet connections. Do not use this; use `VisaInstrument` instead.\n",
    "- `Instrument` - superclass of both `VisaInstrument` and `IPInstrument`, use this if you do not communicate over a text channel, for example:\n",
    "  - PCI cards with their own DLLs\n",
    "  - Instruments with only manual controls.\n",
    "  \n",

    "## Parameters and Channels\n",
    "\n",
    "Broadly speaking, a QCoDeS instrument driver is nothing but an object that holds a connection handle to the physical instrument and has some sub-objects that represent the state of the physical instrument. These sub-objects are the `Parameters`. Writing a driver basically boils down to adding a ton of `Parameters`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What's a Parameter?\n",
    "\n",
    "A parameter represents a single value of a single feature of an instrument, e.g. the frequency of a function generator, the mode of a multimeter (resistance, current, or voltage), or the input impedance of an oscilloscope channel. Each `Parameter` can have the following attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `name`, the name used internally by QCoDeS, e.g. 'input_impedance'\n",
    "  * `label`, the label to use for plotting this parameter\n",
    "  * `unit`, the physical unit. ALWAYS use SI units if a unit is applicable\n",
    "  * `set_cmd`, the command to set the parameter. Either a SCPI string with a single '{}', or a function taking one argument (see examples below)\n",
    "  * `get_cmd`, the command to get the parameter. Follows the same scheme as `set_cmd`\n",
    "  * `vals`, a validator (from `qcodes.utils.validators`) to reject invalid values before they are sent to the instrument. Since there is no standard for how an instrument responds to an out-of-bound value (e.g. a 10 kHz function generator receiving 12e9 for its frequency), meaning that the user can expect anything from silent failure to the instrument breaking or suddenly outputting random noise, it is MUCH better to catch invalid values in software. Therefore, please provide a validator if at all possible.\n",
    "  * `val_mapping`, a dictionary mapping human-readable values like 'High Impedance' to the instrument's internal representation like '372'. Not always needed. If supplied, a validator is automatically constructed.\n",
    "  * `get_parser`, a parser of the raw return value. Since all VISA instruments return strings, but users usually want numbers, `int` and `float` are popular `get_parsers`\n",
    "  * `docstring` A short string describing the function of the parameter\n",
    "  \n",
    "Golden rule: if a `Parameter` is settable, it must always accept its own output as input.\n",
    "\n",
    "In most cases you will probably be adding parameters via the `add_parameter` method on the instrument class as shown in the example below. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to parameters QCoDeS instruments implement the concept of functions that can be added to the instrument via `add_function`. They are meant to implement simple actions on the instrument such as resetting it. However, the functions do not add any value over normal python methods in the driver Class and we are planning to eventually remove them from QCoDeS. **We therefore encourage any driver developer to not use function in any new driver**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What's a Channel, then?\n",
    "\n",
    "A `Channel` is a submodule holding `Parameter`s. It sometimes makes sense to group `Parameter`s, for instance when an oscilloscope has four identical input channels. (see Keithley example below)"

    "## Logging\n",
    "Every QCoDeS module should have its own logger that is named with the name of the module. So to create a logger put a line at the top of the module like this:\n",
    "```\n",
    "log = logging.getLogger(__name__)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Use this logger only to log messages that are not originating from an `Instrument` instance. For messages from within an instrument instance use the `log` member of the `Instrument` class, e.g\n",
    "```\n",
    "self.log.info(f\"Could not connect at {address}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "This way the instrument name will be prepended to the log message and the log messages can be filtered according to the instrument they originate from. See the example notebook of the logger module for more info ([offline](../logging/logging_example.ipynb),[online](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/QCoDeS/Qcodes/tree/master/docs/examples/logging/logging_example.ipynb)).\n",
    "\n",
    "When creating a nested `Instrument`, like e.g. something like the `InstrumentChannel` class, that has a `_parent` property, make sure that this property gets set before calling the `super().__init__` method, so that the full name of the instrument gets resolved correctly for the logging.\n"

Here we also define a new `CurrentParameter` class that uses the ithaco parameters to convert a measured voltage to a current. When subclassing a parameter class (`Parameter`, `MultiParameter`, ...), the functions for setting and getting should be called `get_raw` and `set_raw`, respectively."

    "Frequently, an instrument has parameters which can be expressed in terms of \"something is on or off\". Moreover, usually it is not easy to translate the lingo of the instrument to something that can have simply the value of `True` or `False` (which are typical in software). Even further, it may be difficult to find consensus between users on a convention: is it `on`/`off`, or `ON`/`OFF`, or python `True`/`False`, or `1`/`0`, or else?\n",
    "\n",
    "This case becomes even more complex if the instrument's API (say, corresponding VISA command) uses unexpected values for such a parameter, for example, turning an output \"on\" corresponds to a VISA command `DEV:CH:BLOCK 0` which means \"set blocking of the channel to 0 where 0 has the meaning of the boolean value False, and alltogether this command actually enables the output on this channel\".\n",
    "\n",
    "This results in inconsistency among instrument drivers where for some instrument, say, a `display` parameter has 'on'/'off' values for input, while for a different instrument a similar `display` parameter has `'ON'`/`'OFF'` values or `1`/`0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this particular example of a `display` parameter is trivial because the ambiguity and inconsistency for \"this kind\" of parameters can be solved by having the name of the parameter be `display_enabled` and the allowed input values to be python `bool` `True`/`False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anyway, when defining parameters where the solution does not come trivially, please, consider setting `val_mapping` of a parameter to the output of `create_on_off_val_mapping(on_val=<>, off_val=<>)` function from `qcodes.utils.helpers` package. The function takes care of creating a `val_mapping` dictionary that maps given instrument-side values of `on_val` and `off_val` to `True`/`False`, `'ON'`/`'OFF'`, `'on'`/`'off'`, and other commonly used ones. Note that when getting a value of such a parameter, the user will not get `'ON'` or `'off'` or `'oFF'` - instead, `True`/`False` will be returned."
