QCoDeS 0.48.0 (2024-09-09)
==========================

Improved:
---------

- Improve handling of corner cases where `Instrument.remove_parameter` could raise an exception. (:pr:`6394`)
- `dond` now takes an optional `squeeze` flag as input. Inspired by Matplotlib's `plt.subplots` argument
  of the same name, this allows the user to always get the same type returned from the function if set to False.
  This makes it easier to write type checked code that uses `dond` as a function. (:pr:`6422`)
