    "## Instrument Short info\n",
    "Here a short introduction on how the B1500 measurement system is composed is given. For a detailed overview it is strongly recommended to refer to the *B1500 Programming Guide* and also the *Parametric Measurement Handbook* by Keysight.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Physical grouping\n",
    "The Keysight B1500 Semiconductor Parameter Analyzer consists of a *Mainframe* and can be equipped with various instrument *Modules*. 10 *Slots* are available in which up to 10 *modules* can be installed (some *modules* occupy two *slots*). Each *module* can have one or two *channels*.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Logical grouping\n",
    "The measurements are typically done in one of the 20 measurement modes. The modes can be roughly subdivided into \n",
    "  - Spot measurements\n",
    "      - **High Speed Spot Measurements**\n",
    "  - Pulsed Spot measurement\n",
    "  - Sweep Measurements\n",
    "  - Search Measurements\n",
    "\n",
    "The **High Speed Spot (HSS)** Mode is essentually just a fancy way of saying to take readings and forcing constant voltages/currents. The *HSS* commands work at any time, independent of the currenttly selected Measurment Mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the exception of the *High Speed Spot Measurement Mode*, the other modes have to be activated and configured by the user."

    "## Qcodes driver info\n",
    "As can be seen already from the instrument short info, the instrument is very versatile, but also very complex. Hence the driver will eventually consist of two layers:\n",
    "  - The Low Level interface allows one to utilize all functions of the driver by offering a thin wrapper around the FLEX command set that the B1500 understands. \n",
    "  - A Higher Level interface that provides a convenient access to the more frequently used features. Not all features are available via the high level interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two driver levels can be used at the same time, so even if some functionality is not yet implemented in the high-level interface, the user can send a corresponding low-level command.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Integer Flags and Constants used in the driver\n",
    "Both the high-level and the low-level interface use integer constants in many commands. For user convienience, the `qcodes.instrument_drivers.Keysight.keysightb1500.constants` provides more descriptive Python Enums for these constants. Although bare integer values can still be used, it is highly recommended to use the enumerations in order to avoid mistakes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### High level interface\n",
    "The high level exposes instrument functionality via QCodes Parameters and Python methods on the mainframe object and the individual instrument module objects. For example, *High Speed Spot* Measurement commands for forcing constant voltages/currents or for taking simple readings are implemented.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Low level interface\n",
    "The Low Level interface (`MessageBuilder` class) provides a wrapper function for each FLEX command. From the low-level, the full functionality of the instrument can be controlled.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `MessageBuilder` assembles a message string which later can be sent to the instrument using the low level `write` and `ask` methods. One can also use the `MessageBuilder` to write FLEX complex measurement routines that are stored in the B1500 and can be executed at a later point. This can be done to enable fast execution."
