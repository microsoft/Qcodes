# A brief overview of what each version introduces:
#
# Version 0: the original table schema, runs, experiments, layouts,
# dependencies, result-tables
#
# Version 1: a GUID column is added to the runs table
#
# Version 2: indices are added to runs; GUID and exp_id
#
# Version 3: run_description column is added to the runs table
#

# NOTE that each hash is supposed to be representing a commit JUST before the
# "next" version is being introduced.
