"""
The storage-facing module that handles serializations and deserializations
of the top-level object, the RunDescriber into and from different versions.

Note that we require strict backwards and forwards compatibility such that
the current RunDescriber must always be deserializable from any older or newer
serialization.

This means that a new version cannot delete/omit previously included fields
from the serialization and the deserialization must be written such that it
can handle that any new field may be missing.

The above excludes v1 that only serialized for a short amount of time.
See py:module`.database_fix_functions` to convert v1 RunDescribers that has
been written to the db.

Serialization is implemented in two steps: converting RunDescriber objects to
plain python dicts first, and then converting them to plain formats such as
json or yaml. The dict representation of the ``RunDescriber`` is defined in
py:module`.rundescribertypes`

Moreover this module introduces the following terms for the versions of
RunDescriber object:

- storage version: the version of RunDescriber serialization that is used
by the data storage infrastructure of QCoDeS.

The names of the functions in this module follow the "to_*"/"from_*"
convention where "*" stands for the storage format. Also note the
"as_version", "for_storage", and "to_current" suffixes.
