QCoDeS 0.46.0 (2024-06-10)
==========================

Breaking Changes:
-----------------


- This will be the last version of QCoDeS to support Python 3.9

- The keyword arguments expected to be passed to ``InstrumentBase`` and ``VisaInstrument`` subclasses are now
  documented as TypedDics classes that can be used to type `**kwargs` in the subclass constructors.
  See `Creating QCoDeS instrument drivers` for usage examples.

  This also means that the these arguments **must** be passed as keyword arguments, and not as positional arguments.
  This specifically includeds passing ``label`` and ``metadata`` to direct subclasses of ``Instrument`` as well as
  ``terminator`` to subclasses of ``VisaInstrument``.

  All drivers shipping with qcodes for Vendors from A-K have been updated in this pr.
  The remaining drivers were updated in (:pr:`6087`). (:pr:`6012`)


Improved:
---------

- `InstrumentBase.add_parameter` now returns the created parameter.
  This allows explicitly assigning the parameter as an attribute on
  the instrument class. This in turn enables type checkers and
  documentation tools to detect the existence and type of the
  parameter statically.

  QCoDeS ships with a tool to automatically refactor instruments in this way. To use
  this tool qcodes should be installed with the refactor option e.g. ``pip install qcodes[refactor]``

  See `Creating-Instrument-Drivers <../examples/writing_drivers/Creating-Instrument-Drivers.ipynb>`__
  for more details.

  It is the plan to transform all drivers shipping with QCoDeS in this way
  as soon as possible. (:pr:`4412`)
- Accept sequences of values for setting `MultiChannelInstrumentParameter` s. Previously, the behavior was inconsistent since `param.set(param.get())` would error. (:pr:`6073`)
- Add update_spapshot argument to Station.load_instrument() (:pr:`6075`)
- Measurement.register_parameter() now tests for correct types of arguments setpoints and basis. (:pr:`6084`)


Improved Drivers:
-----------------

- The Agilent drivers shipping with QCoDeS have been updated to ensure all Parameters are set as static
  attributes that are documented and can be type checked. The docs for the Agilent drivers have been
  updated to not document inherited members. This makes the documentation significantly more readable
  as it focuses on specific members for a given instrument. The documentation now also links superclasses.
  Please consult these for inherited members. It is the plan to make the same change to all drivers shipping
  with QCoDeS in the near future. (:pr:`6089`)
- The Aim TTi drivers shipping with QCoDeS have been updated to ensure all Parameters are set as static
  attributes that are documented and can be type checked. The docs for the Aim TTi drivers have been
  updated to not document inherited members. This makes the documentation significantly more readable
  as it focuses on specific members for a given instrument. The documentation now also links superclasses.
  Please consult these for inherited members. (:pr:`6105`)
- Fix AlazarTech ATS drivers trying to create an instrument with invalid identifier as name (:pr:`6106`)
- The Alazar Tech, American Magnetics, Basel, Cryomagnetics and Galil drivers shipping with QCoDeS

  attributes that are documented and can be type checked. The docs for the same drivers have been
  updated to not document inherited members. This makes the documentation significantly more readable
  as it focuses on specific members for a given instrument. The documentation now also links superclasses.
