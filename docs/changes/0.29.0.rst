Changelog for QCoDeS 0.29.0
===========================

The September 2021 release of QCoDeS.


----
New:
----

- Simultaneous ramping feature that enables you to sweep an AMI 3D magnet to (x,y,z) in
  time T or at vector ramp rate R, ramping all 3 axes together (in parallel) and
  making a linear/vector trajectory from current field to the setpoint
  in 3D magnetic field space. Please see updates to the AMI magnet driver example
  documentation. (#3233)
- Galil DMC-41x3 stepper motor controller that can be used with Janis probes for
  moving the measurement arm. (#2626)


---------
Improved:
---------

- Documentation: clarified contribution guides and contacts (#3375, #3370)
- Raise ``ValueError`` if given more than one result for the same parameter name
  in ``DataSaver.add_result``. (#3265)


-----------------
Improved drivers:
-----------------

- Keithley 2600 SMU support to return both voltage and current compliance limit errors. (#3339, #3362)
- Make ``SR86xBufferReadout`` parameter take kwargs and pass them to base class. (#3341)


---------------
Under the hood:
---------------

- Logging update to explicitly set encoding for file handler thus
  preventing issues on systems with less widespread encodings. (#3327)
- Add type packages discovered by mypy --install-types. (#3379)
- Resolved uncertainties package issues. (#3334)
- ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md updates for reporting a bug. (#3345)
- Make it possible to manually trigger codeql, using codeql-analysis.yml
  recommended by github. (#3314, #3329)
- Remove redundant filters from test runner. (#3295)
