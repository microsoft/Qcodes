QCoDes API documentation
========================

This page documents the QCoDes API. This page contains documentation of all user facing modules.
A few of our modules are considered legacy and documented separately below.
This is split in roughly one page per QCoDeS submodule. A few of the submodules have been split for
additional clarity.
