An abstract instrument (An instrument with one or more abstract parameters) will now raise at
instrument creation time preventing such an instrument from being created.
This makes it easier to define interfaces that multiple instruments must implement.
See `here <../examples/writing_drivers/abstract_instruments.ipynb>`__ for examples of how to use
this.
