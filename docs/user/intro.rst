Introduction
============

The goal is a common framework for all of our experiments, so:

- new students don't need to spend a long time learning software in order to
  participate in experiments 
- nobody has to write their own code except for pieces that are very specific
  to their own experiment 
- and even then we will try to merge a lot of this code back into the main project.
- we streamline the process of moving between teams or labs, and of setting up
  a new experiment. 
- we can take advantage of modern software and best practices so the system is
  easy to maintain and extend as needs and technologies change
