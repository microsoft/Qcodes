QCoDeS 0.54.3 (2025-11-11)
==========================

Improved:
---------

- - Improved pyvisa-sim YAMLs for Lakeshore Models 335, 336, and 372.
  - Updated Lakeshore tests to use pyvisa-sim backend instead of mocked classes.
  - Updated lakeshore_base.py to bypass waiting when using blocking_t in sim mode. (:pr:`7606`)
- Fixes a bug in the LinSweeper iterator that caused it to always raise StopIteration after
  completing a single sweep. This bug meant LinSweeper could not be used in a nested measurement function. (:pr:`7607`)

Improved Drivers:
-----------------

- The Stanford SR86x drivers now statically assign attributes statically
  for more member InstrumentModules and parameters enabling better documentation,
  type checking and IDE integration. (:pr:`7542`)
