Changelog for QCoDeS 0.6.0 (unreleased)
========================================

The August 2019 release of QCoDeS

New:
____

* The QCoDeS experiment sqlite database is now created in WAL mode. (#1685)
  This gives better performance in general. Especially when doing concurrent reads and writes from the db.
  Note that if you perform a manual backup of a db in wal mode you should also backup any .wal file along
  with the .db file. See https://www.sqlite.org/wal.html for additional details.

Significant improvements to import time of QCoDeS (#1678)

Breaking Changes:
_________________

* The default config value for ``gui.plotlib`` has changed from ``"all"`` to ``null``. This means the
  legacy plot modules ``MatPlot`` and ``QtPlot`` are no longer imported into the top level qcodes namespace by
  default. To restore the original behaviour change your config file locally.

* ``capture_dataframe`` is no longer available from ``qcodes.logger``. To use it import it
  from ``qcodes.logger.log_analysis``
