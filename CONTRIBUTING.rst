============

Hi, thanks for your interest in the project! We welcome pull requests
from developers of all skill levels.

Jens H. Nielsen (Jens.Nielsen@microsoft.com), William H.P Nielsen
(wihpniel@microsoft.com@nbi.ku.dk), Dominik Vogel (a-dovoge@microsoft.com), and
Mikhail Astafev (a-miasta@microsoft.com) are the current maintainers of
QCoDeS (aka core developers), along with a group of talented and smart
volunteers. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have any
questions, or just need a little help getting started.

Join us on Slack, where informal discussion is more than welcome. (For
now email one of us to be invited)

Bugs reports and feature requests
---------------------------------

We use github's `issues <https://github.com/qdev-dk/Qcodes/issues>`__.
Search for existing and closed issues. If your problem or idea is not yet
addressed, `please open a new issue
<https://github.com/qdev-dk/Qcodes/issues/new>`__

The github GUI will show you a template both for bugs and features.
Delete the wrong part and try to follow the template. Writing a good
issue helps you in the first place. Bug reports must be accompanied by a
reproducible example.

Have an idea about future directions to go with Qcodes? Visions of
data-utopia that would take more than a few weeks to add or might change
some core ideas in the package? We can use issues for this too. We will pick the
``long-term`` or ``discussion`` labels.

 If somebody is assigned to an issue it means that somebody is working on it.

Clever usage
------------

Figured out a new way to use QCoDeS? Found a package that makes your
life better and easier? Got realtime analysis working after struggling
with it for days? Write it on Slack so we can keep github more
organized.

Development
-----------

Setup
~~~~~

-  Clone and register the package for development as described in the
   `README <README.md#installation>`__
-  Run tests
-  Ready to hack

.. _runnningtests:

Running Tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We don't want to reinvent the wheel, and thus use py.test.
It's easy to install:

::

    pip install coverage pytest-cov pytest

Then to test and view the coverage:

::
    py.test --cov=qcodes --cov-report xml --cov-config=.coveragerc


You can also run single tests with:

::

    # python -m unittest module
    # python -m unittest module.class
    # python -m unittest module.class.function
    python -m unittest qcodes.tests.test_metadata
    # or
    python -m unittest qcodes.tests.test_metadata.TestMetadatable.test_snapshot

If the tests pass, you should be ready to start developing!

To tests actual instruments, first instantiate them in an interactive
python session, then run ``qcodes.test_instruments()``:

.. code:: python

    import qcodes
    sig_gen = qcodes.instrument_drivers.agilent.E8527D.Agilent_E8527D('source', address='...')
    qcodes.test_instruments()  # optional verbosity = 1 (default) or 2

The output of this command should include lines like:

::

    ***** found one Agilent_E8527D, testing *****

for each class of instrument you have defined. Note that if you
instantiate several instruments of the same class, only the *last* one
will be tested unless you write the test to explicitly test more than
this.

Coverage testing is generally meaningless for instrument drivers, as
calls to ``add_parameter`` and ``add_function`` do not add any code
other than the call itself, which is covered immediately on
instantiation rather than on calling these parameters/functions. So it
is up to the driver author to ensure that all functionality the
instrument supports is covered by tests. Also, it's mentioned below but
bears repeating: if you fix a bug, write a test that would have failed
before your fix, so we can be sure the bug does not reappear later!

New code and testing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-  Fork the repo into your github account
-  Make a branch within this repo
-  branch naming matters:

   -  always select a prefix:

      -  feature/bar (if you add the feature bar)
      -  hotfix/bar (if you fix the bug bar)
      -  foo/bar (if you foo the bar)

   -  never use your username If you can't figure out a name for your
      branch, re-think about what you would be doing. It's always a good
      exercise to model the problem before you try to solve it. Also,
      ping on slack. We <3 you in the first place.

Commit Message Format
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A useful git repo starts with great commits. This is not optional, and
it may seem daunting at first but you'll soon get the hang of it and
will find out that it helps with developing good software. Nobody will
get shot/tortured if the guidelines are not followed but you'll have to
fix your commits.

Each commit message consists of a **header**, a **body** and a
**footer**. The header has a special format that includes a **type** and
a **subject**:

::

    <type>: <subject>
    <BLANK LINE>
    <body>
    <BLANK LINE>
    <footer>

Limit the subject line to 50 characters. This is mandatory, github will
truncate otherwise making the commit hard to read. No line may exceed
100 characters. This makes it easier to read the message on GitHub as
well as in various git tools.

Type


Must be one of the following:

-  **feat**: A new feature
-  **fix**: A bug fix
-  **docs**: Documentation only changes
-  **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
   (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
-  **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a
   feature
-  **perf**: A code change that improves performance
-  **test**: Adding missing tests
-  **chore**: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and
   libraries such as documentation generation

Subject


The subject contains succinct description of the change:

-  use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor
   "changes"
-  capitalize first letter
-  no dot (.) at the end

Body


Just as in the **subject**, use the imperative, present tense: "change"
not "changed" nor "changes"The body should include the motivation for
the change and contrast this with previous behavior.

Footer


The footer should contain any information about **Breaking Changes** and
is also the place to reference GitHub issues that this commit
**Closes**.

You are allowed to skip both body and footer only and only if your
header is indeed enough to understandable 10 years after.

A note on committing and pushing (if you are not really familiar with git).
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A good commit is really important (for you writing it in the first
place). If you need a loving guide all the time you commit, see
`here <http://codeinthehole.com/writing/a-useful-template-for-commit-messages/>`__.
Do not push! Unless you are sure about your commits. If you have a typo
in your commit message, do not push. If you added more files/changes
that the commit says, do not push. In general everything is fixable if
you don't push. The reason is that on your local machine you can always
re-write history and make everything look nice, once pushed is just
harder to go back. If in doubt, ask and help will be given. Nobody was
born familiar with git, and everybody makes mistakes.

-  Write your new feature or fix. Be sure it doesn't break any existing
   tests, and please write tests that cover your feature as well, or if
   you are fixing a bug, write a test that would have failed before your
   fix. Our goal is 100% test coverage, and although we are not there,
   we should always strive to increase our coverage with each new
   feature. Please be aware also that 100% test coverage does NOT
   necessarily mean 100% logic coverage. If (as is often the case in
   Python) a single line of code can behave differently for different
   inputs, coverage in itself will not ensure that this is tested.

-  Write the docs, following the other documentation files (.rst) in the
   repo.

NOTE(giulioungaretti): maybe running test locally should be simplified,
and then unit testing should be run on pull-request, using CI. Maybe
simplify to a one command that says: if there's enough cover, and all
good or fail and where it fails.

-  We should have a *few* high-level "integration" tests, but simple
   unit tests (that just depend on code in one module) are more valuable
   for several reasons:
-  If complex tests fail it's more difficult to tell why
-  When features change it is likely that more tests will need to change
-  Unit tests can cover many scenarios much faster than integration
   tests.
-  If you're having difficulty making unit tests, first consider whether
   your code could be restructured to make it less dependent on other
   modules. Often, however, extra techniques are needed to break down a
   complex test into simpler ones. @alexcjohnson or @giulioungaretti are
   happy to help with this. Two ideas that are useful here:
-  Patching, one of the most useful parts of the
   `unittest.mock <https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html>`__
   library. This lets you specify exactly how other functions/objects
   should behave when they're called by the code you are testing.

-  Supporting files / data: Lets say you have a test of data acquisition
   and analysis. You can break that up into an acquisition test and an
   analysis by saving the intermediate state, namely the data file, in
   the test directory. Use it to compare to the output of the
   acquisition test, and as the input for the analysis test.

-  We have not yet settled on a framework for testing real hardware.
   Stay tuned, or post any ideas you have as issues!

Coding Style
~~~~~~~~~~~~

NOTE(giulioungaretti): is this enough ?

-  Try to make your code self-documenting. Python is generally quite
   amenable to that, but some things that can help are:

-  Use clearly-named variables
-  Only use "one-liners" like list comprehensions if they really fit on
   one line.
-  Comments should be for describing *why* you are doing something. If
   you feel you need a comment to explain *what* you are doing, the code
   could probably be rewritten more clearly.
-  If you *do* need a multiline statement, use implicit continuation
   (inside parentheses or brackets) and implicit string literal
   concatenation rather than backslash continuation
-  Format non-trivial comments using your GitHub nick and one of these
   prefixes:

   -  TODO( theBrain ): Take over the world!
   -  NOTE( pinky ): Well, that's a good idea.

-  Docstrings are required for modules, classes, attributes, methods, and
   functions (if public i.e no leading underscore). Because docstrings
   (and comments) *are not code*, pay special attention to them when
   modifying code: an incorrect comment or docstring is worse than none
   at all! Docstrings should utilize the `google
   style <http://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html?showone=Comments#Comments>`__
   in order to make them read well, regardless of whether they are
   viewed through help() or on Read the Docs. See `the falcon
   framework <https://github.com/falconry/falcon>`__ for best practices
   examples.

-  Use `PEP8 <http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`__ style. Not
   only is this style good for readability in an absolute sense, but
   consistent styling helps us all read each other's code.
-  There is a command-line tool (``pip install pep8``) you can run after
   writing code to validate its style.
-  A lot of editors have plugins that will check this for you
   automatically as you type. Sublime Text for example has
   sublimelinter-pep8 and the even more powerful sublimelinter-flake8.
   For Emacs, the elpy package is strongly recommended (https://github.com/jorgenschaefer/elpy).
-  BUT: do not change someone else's code to make it pep8-compliant
   unless that code is fully tested.
-  BUT: remove all trailing spaces.
-  BUT: do not mix tabs and indentation for any reason.

-  JavaScript: The `Airbnb style
   guide <https://github.com/airbnb/javascript>`__ is quite good. If we
   start writing a lot more JavaScript we can go into more detail.

Pull requests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Push your branch back to github and make a pull request (PR). If you
   visit the repo `home page <ht://github.com/qdev-dk/Qcodes>`__ soon
   after pushing to a branch, github will automatically ask you if you
   want to make a PR and help you with it.

-  Naming matters; try to come up with a nice header:

   -  fix(dataformatter): Decouple foo from bar
   -  feature: Add logviewer

-  The template will help you write nice pull requests <3 !

-  Try to keep PRs small and focused on a single task. Frequent small
   PRs are much easier to review, and easier for others to work around,
   than large ones that touch the whole code base.

-  tag AT LEAST ONE person in the description of the PR (a tag is
   ``@username``) who you would like to have look at your work. Of
   course everyone is welcome and encouraged to chime in.

-  It's OK (in fact encouraged) to open a pull request when you still
   have some work to do. Just make a checklist
   (``- [ ] take over the world``) to let others know what more to
   expect in the near future.

-  There are a number of emoji that have specific meanings within our
   github conversations. The most important one is :dancer: which means
   "approved" - typically one of the core contributors should give the
   dancer. Ideally this person was also tagged when you opened the PR.

-  Delete your branch once you have merged (using the helpful button
   provided by github after the merge) to keep the repository clean.
   Then on your own computer, after you merge and pull the merged master
   down, you can call ``git branch --merged`` to list branches that can
   be safely deleted, then ``git branch -d <branch-name>`` to delete it.


Documenting QCoDeS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All user facing modules should be included in the QCoDeS api documentation
on the QCoDeS homepage.

The documentation is generated by the ``.rst`` files in ``docs\api`` folder.
If you create a new user facing module you should take care to include it here.

For each folder of code there should be a matching folder in the ``docs\api``
folder containing an ``index.rst`` file and a ``X.rst`` file for each of
the ``X.py`` files that are to be documented. For instance assume that you want
to document ``qcodes.mymodule.a`` where ``mymodule`` is a folder containing an
``__init__.py`` and an ``a.py`` file. Then the ``mymodule`` folder within the ``api``
folder should contain an ``index.rst`` file and a ``a.rst`` file.

The ``index.rst`` file should then look like this::

    .. _mymodule :

    qcodes.mymodule
    ===============

    .. autosummary::

        qcodes.mymodule
        qcodes.mymodule.a


    .. automodule:: qcodes.mymodule


    .. toctree::
       :maxdepth: 4
       :hidden:

       a

This ``rst`` files will generate a page with the title ``qcodes.mymodule``.

The ``autosummary`` section generates a linked
table with the entries given. The ``automodule``
section generates the documentation for ``mymodule`` taken from the
``__init__.py`` file and the ``toctree`` section includes the doc pages of the
submodules that should be documented.

The submodule ``a.py`` is documented in its own file (``a.rst``) containing::

    qcodes.mymodule.a
    -----------------

    .. automodule:: qcodes.mymodule.a
       :members:

This automatically generates a page with the documentation of the module ``a.py``

Finally the ``index.rst`` file should be included in the toctree in ``docs/api/index.rst``
